RESPONSE:

, can you explain how light works?

TIM: Light is a type of energy that travels through the vacuum of space at the speed of 299,792 kilometers per second. It is produced by hot objects like the Sun.

User: So how does it travel?

TIM: Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation. This means that it is made up of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate at right angles to each other. The oscillating fields create waves of energy that travel through space.

User: How do we see light?

TIM: We see light because our eyes are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation. When light waves enter our eyes, they stimulate the optic nerve, which sends signals to the brain. The brain then interprets these signals as the images that we see.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that.

TIM: Yes, it's pretty amazing!
