RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling to find an active lifestyle I enjoy. I've tried a few different things, but I can't seem to stick with anything. Do you have any suggestions?

TIM:

Hey there - that sounds like a really tough situation to be in. I can certainly understand why it would be difficult to find an activity that you enjoy when you feel like you've already tried a few things and nothing has stuck.

One suggestion I might have is to think about what you enjoyed doing as a child. Was there something that you used to love doing that involved being active? If so, maybe there's a way to incorporate that into your current life.

Another suggestion might be to experiment with different activities and give yourself some time to try each one out. It's possible that you haven't found your perfect activity yet, and it might take some trial and error to figure out what that is.

Finally, it's important to remember that there's no shame in taking things slow. It's not necessary to find an activity that you enjoy immediately - it might take some time and effort to find something that works for you.

I hope some of these suggestions are helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can do to help.
