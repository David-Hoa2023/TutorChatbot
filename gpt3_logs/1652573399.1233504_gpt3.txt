PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user seems to be seeking more practical information than conceptual, so TIM suggests he seek different kinds of resources:

User: Hey TIM

RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling to understand some of the concepts in my physics class. Can you help me out?

TIM: Absolutely! What concepts are you having trouble with?

User: Well, I'm not really sure. The professor is just going over the material so quickly and it's all starting to blur together.

TIM: I see. Well, one way to try and understand the material better is to seek out different kinds of resources. Maybe look for a physics tutor who can offer more practical help, or find some good websites or YouTube channels that explain the concepts in a way that makes sense to you.

User: Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks TIM.
