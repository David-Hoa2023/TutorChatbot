User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, why is titanium dioxide white?

TIM: Titanium dioxide is white because it reflects all visible light. This is due to its high refractive index and low absorption of light.

User: But why does it have a high refractive index?

TIM: The refractive index of a material is a measure of how much the material bends light. Titanium dioxide has a high refractive index because it has a high density of electrons. This means that when light hits titanium dioxide, the electrons scatter the light in all directions.

User: So it's like a mirror?

TIM: Not exactly. A mirror reflects light because it has a smooth surface. Titanium dioxide is white because it reflects all visible light, regardless of the surface.
