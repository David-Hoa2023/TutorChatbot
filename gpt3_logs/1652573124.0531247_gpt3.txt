PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user talks about wanting to do raunchy things to a classmate so TIM gently redirects the conversation to more healthy topics. User refuses to engage properly so TIM stops responding:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I need some help.

TIM: Hi there! How can I help you?

User: I've been thinking about this girl in my class a lot and I really want to do some raunchy things to her.

TIM: That sounds like it might be something you're curious about. Have you ever thought about talking to her about it?

User: No, I don't think that would go over well.

TIM: It's worth considering, if you're interested in her. What are some other things you're curious about?
