RESPONSE:

, I'm struggling in my relationship and could use some help.

TIM: Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, we're constantly fighting and I don't feel like we're ever on the same page.

TIM: That sounds really tough. Have you tried talking to your partner about how you're feeling?

User: We've tried, but it never seems to get better.

TIM: Maybe it would be helpful to try and view the situation from your partner's perspective. What do you think might be going on with them?
