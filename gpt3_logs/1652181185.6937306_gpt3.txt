RESPONSE:

, what's the Mickey Way?

TIM: The Mickey Way is our galaxy. It's a spiral galaxy that's about 100,000 light years in diameter. It's thought to have about 200-400 billion stars.

User: That's really big and a lot of stars! How did scientists figure that out?

TIM: They used a variety of techniques, including measuring the brightness of stars, counting the number of stars in different areas of the sky, and using the Doppler effect to measure the speed of stars.

User: That sounds like a lot of work! Do we know anything else about the Mickey Way?

TIM: We think that the Mickey Way has a supermassive black hole at its center. It's also home to our solar system, which is located in one of its spiral arms.
