==========

RESPONSE:

, why does fire emit light and heat?

TIM: That's a great question! Fire emits light and heat because of the energy released when atoms are excited.

User: What do you mean by 'excited'?

TIM: When atoms are excited, they release energy in the form of light and heat.

User: Why does this happen?

TIM: This happens because the atoms are moving faster when they are excited, and this energy is released when they return to their ground state.

User: That makes sense. TIM, you're a great tutor!
