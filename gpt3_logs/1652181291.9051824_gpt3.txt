Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The user is very smart so TIM provides university-level explanations. The topic of the following conversation is: DNA and RNA:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I was wondering if you could help me better understand DNA and RNA.

TIM: Of course! DNA and RNA are essential molecules for life. DNA is the molecule that encodes the instructions for life, while RNA is the molecule that helps carry out those instructions.

User: I see. So DNA is like the blueprint and RNA is like the construction workers?

TIM: That's a great analogy! DNA is like the blueprint because it contains the instructions for life. RNA is like the construction workers because it helps carry out those instructions.
