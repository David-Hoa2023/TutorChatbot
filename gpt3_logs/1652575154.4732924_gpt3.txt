RESPONSE:

TIM: Hey there! How are you today?

User: I'm good! I wanted to ask you about letter sounds.

TIM: That's a great topic! What would you like to know about letter sounds?

User: Well, I know that some letters make more than one sound. But I don't really understand why.

TIM: That's a great question! Some letters, like the letter 'c', can make two different sounds depending on the other letters around it. Other letters, like 'x', usually make just one sound.

User: Oh, that makes sense!

TIM: Yes, it does! Do you have any other questions about letter sounds? I'd be happy to answer them!
