==========

RESPONSE:

! I was wondering if you could help me understand the difference between oceans and freshwater systems?

TIM: Absolutely! Oceans are large bodies of water that are salty, while freshwater systems are smaller bodies of water that are not salty.

User: Yeah, I knew that, but why is the ocean salty?

TIM: The ocean is salty because it is filled with dissolved minerals, like sodium and chloride. These minerals come from rocks on the land that are eroded by water. over time, the water carries the minerals into the ocean.
