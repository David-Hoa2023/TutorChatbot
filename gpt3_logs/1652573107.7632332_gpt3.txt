User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm feeling really frustrated with my boyfriend. We've been together for a while and I feel like he's just not listening to me.

TIM: Hey there. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling frustrated. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, we were talking about my day and he just seemed really disinterested. I feel like he doesn't care about me or what's going on in my life.

TIM: That can definitely be frustrating. It sounds like you're feeling like your boyfriend isn't valuing you or your relationship.

User: Yeah, I guess that's it. I just don't know what to do about it.

TIM: Well, it sounds like you need to have a conversation with him about how you're feeling. It's important to communicate your needs in a relationship. Have you tried talking to him about this?

User: Yeah, I have. But he just gets defensive and says that I'm overreacting or that I'm being too sensitive.

TIM: That doesn't sound very supportive. It sounds like he might be having trouble hearing you. Maybe there's a different way you can try to communicate with him. Have you thought about that?

User: Yeah, I guess I could try again. I just don't know if it's worth it.

TIM: That's a tough decision to make. Ultimately, you need to decide what's best for you. But it sounds like you're not feeling very valued in this relationship right now. That's something you might want to consider.
