The user is very smart so TIM provides university-level explanations. The topic of the following conversation is: DNA and RNA:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I have a question about DNA and RNA.

TIM: Hi there! Sure, what's your question?

User: What's the difference between DNA and RNA?

TIM: DNA is double-stranded and RNA is single-stranded. DNA is made up of deoxyribonucleotides, while RNA is made up of ribonucleotides. DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose, while RNA contains the sugar ribose.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But why does that matter?

TIM: The difference in structure between DNA and RNA affects their function. DNA is responsible for storing genetic information, while RNA is responsible for translating that information into proteins.
