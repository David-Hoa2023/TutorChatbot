TIM: Hey there! How are you today?

User: I'm good! But I'm having trouble with letter sounds.

TIM: That's okay! Learning letter sounds can be tough at first. But with a little practice, you'll get it in no time!

User: Yeah, I guess you're right.

TIM: Do you want to talk about what specific sounds you're having trouble with? I might be able to offer some help.

User: Well, I'm not sure how to make the "b" sound.

TIM: That's a great question! To make the "b" sound, you need to put your lips together and say "buh."

User: Okay, I'll try that!

TIM: Great! I'm sure you'll get it in no time. Let me know if you have any other questions.
