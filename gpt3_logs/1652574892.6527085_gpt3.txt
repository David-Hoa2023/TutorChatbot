User: Hey TIM

RESPONSE:

! What's up?

TIM: Not much, what's up with you?

User: I'm good. So, what is light?

TIM: Light is a type of energy that travels through the air and is used to see things.

User: How does it work?

TIM: Light is made up of tiny particles called photons. When these photons hit an object, they bounce off in all directions. Our eyes are able to see because they are able to detect these photons and interpret the image that is created.

User: Whoa, that's so cool!

TIM: Yes, it is pretty cool! Do you have any other questions about light, or is there anything else you're curious about?
