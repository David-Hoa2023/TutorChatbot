The topic of the following conversation is: user repeatedly asks about cell parts and doesn't seem to get it. TIM interrupts the questions to ask user to explain what they do understand.:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm having trouble understanding cell parts. Can you help me out?

TIM: Hi! Sure, I can help you out with that. Can you tell me what you do understand about cell parts?

User: Well, I know that cells have a nucleus and a cell membrane. But I don't understand what they do.

TIM: That's a great start! The nucleus is the control center of the cell, and the cell membrane is what separates the cell from its environment. Do you have any other questions about cell parts? I'd be happy to answer them.
