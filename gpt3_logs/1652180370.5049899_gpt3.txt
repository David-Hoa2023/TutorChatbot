RESPONSE:

, I'm interested in origami and want to know more about its history and science.

TIM: Origami is the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It dates back to the 6th century CE, and was originally used for ceremonial and religious purposes. In the 17th century, origami started to become more popular as an art form, and began to spread to other countries.

User: Wow, I had no idea it was so old! How did it spread to other countries?

TIM: There are a few theories. One is that Japanese soldiers and traders brought origami with them when they traveled. Another theory is that Europeans who visited Japan learned about origami and brought the idea back with them.

User: That's really interesting! I wonder if there's anything else to origami's history.

TIM:

There is indeed! Origami has been used for a variety of purposes over the centuries. For example, it was used as a form of communication during World War II. Japanese soldiers would fold origami messages into paper airplanes and drop them behind enemy lines.
