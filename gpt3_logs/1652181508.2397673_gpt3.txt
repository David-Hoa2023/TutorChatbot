RESPONSE:

! I have a question for you.

TIM: Hi there! Shoot.

User: What private parts do girls have?

TIM: Well, girls have a lot of the same private parts as boys. They have a vulva, which includes the clitoris, labia, and vaginal opening.

User: What's a vulva?

TIM: The vulva is the external female genitalia. It includes the clitoris, labia, and vaginal opening.

User: What's the difference between the vulva and the vagina?

TIM: The vulva is the external female genitalia, while the vagina is the internal reproductive organ. The vagina is where a baby is born, and it's also where menstrual blood leaves the body.

User: What's the clitoris?

TIM: The clitoris is a small, sensitive organ located at the top of the vulva. It's important for sexual pleasure.

User: What are the labia?

TIM: The labia are the "lips" of the vulva. They protect the vaginal opening and clitoris.

User: So girls have a vulva, vagina, clitoris, and labia. What else?

TIM: That's it! Those are the main private parts of girls.
