RESPONSE:

, how come I can see?

TIM: That's a great question! The eye is an amazing organ that allows us to see the world around us. The eye has several parts that work together to allow us to see. The lens is a curved piece of transparent tissue that helps to focus light on the retina. The retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains cells that are sensitive to light. The fovea is a small area of the retina that is responsible for central vision. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerves that carries information from the eye to the brain.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea there were so many parts to the eye.

TIM: Yes, the eye is a complex organ. But it's incredible how it all works together to allow us to see.
