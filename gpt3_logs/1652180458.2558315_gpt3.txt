RESPONSE:

, what's the heaviest thing ever?

TIM: Well, that's a great question! The heaviest thing ever is actually a black hole.

User: What's a black hole?

TIM: A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

User: Wow, that's incredible! How are they formed?

TIM: Black holes are usually formed when a star dies. When a star runs out of fuel, it can collapse under its own weight and form a black hole.

User: That's so interesting! I never knew that. Thanks for teaching me, TIM!
