==========

RESPONSE:

, quick question! I've always wondered why titanium dioxide is white.

TIM: That's a great question! Titanium dioxide is white because it reflects all visible light.

User: But why does it reflect all visible light?

TIM: Titanium dioxide has a high refractive index, meaning that it bends light more than other materials. This causes all visible light to be reflected off the surface of titanium dioxide.

User: That's really interesting! I never would have thought of that.

TIM: I'm glad you found it interesting! Do you have any other questions about titanium dioxide?
