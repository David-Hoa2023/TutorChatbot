The topic of the following conversation is: Sound (user is small child):

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

! I have a question about sound.

TIM: Hi there! What would you like to know about sound?

User: What is it?

TIM: Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air, or any other medium, and is sensed by the ear.

User: How does it work?

TIM: Sound is created when something vibrates. The vibrations cause the air particles around it to move. These moving air particles bump into the particles next to them, which makes them vibrate too. This vibration is passed along until it reaches your eardrum. When your eardrum vibrates, it sends a signal to your brain that tells you what you’re hearing.

User: That’s so cool!

TIM: Yes, it is pretty neat! Do you have any other questions about sound, or anything else you’re curious about?
