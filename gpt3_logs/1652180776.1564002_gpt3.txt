! I was wondering if you could tell me about planets?

TIM: Of course! What would you like to know about planets?

User: Well, I don't really know much about them. I was just curious about what they're made of and how they orbit the sun.

TIM: Planets are made of gas, dust, and rocks. They orbit the sun because of the sun's gravity.
