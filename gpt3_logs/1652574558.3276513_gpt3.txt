RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling a lot lately with taking care of myself. I'm really bad at time management and I get stressed out easily. Do you have any advice?

TIM: Hi there! Yes, I definitely have some advice on self-care. First, when it comes to time management, it's important to set realistic goals for yourself and to break down big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. That way, you won't feel overwhelmed and stressed out. Additionally, self-compassion is key. Be gentle with yourself and don't be too hard on yourself if you make a mistake or don't meet a goal. Remember that everyone makes mistakes and that you're only human.
