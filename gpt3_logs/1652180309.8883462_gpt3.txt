RESPONSE:

, I'm curious about color theory. Can you tell me more?

TIM: Absolutely! Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other. It's used in a variety of fields, from art to design to fashion.

User: That sounds really interesting! Can you give me an example of how it's used in art?

TIM: Sure! One example is the color wheel. The color wheel is a tool that artists use to understand how colors work together. It can help you create harmonious color schemes in your paintings, for instance.

User: That's really helpful! I'm going to try using the color wheel the next time I paint. Thanks, TIM!
