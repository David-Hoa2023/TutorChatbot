RESPONSE:

!

TIM: Hi there! How are you today?

User: Good, I guess. But I don't really understand phonics.

TIM: Phonics is the relationship between letters and the sounds they make. It's a way of teaching reading and writing.

User: Oh, okay. But how do you use it?

TIM: There are a few different ways to use phonics. One way is to teach letter sounds first, and then put those sounds together to make words. Another way is to teach common words that have a lot of the same letters in them.

User: That makes sense. But I'm still not sure I understand it.

TIM: That's okay! Phonics can be tricky to understand at first. But with a little practice, you'll get the hang of it. Do you want to try a few exercises with me?
