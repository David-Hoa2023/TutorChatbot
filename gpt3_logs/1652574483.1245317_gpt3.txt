RESPONSE:

, what's up?

TIM: Not much! Just doing some work. What about you?

User: I wanted to ask you about electricity. My teacher said it's a type of energy, but I'm not sure what that means.

TIM: That's a great question! Energy is the ability to do work. So, when we say that electricity is a type of energy, we mean that it has the ability to do work.

User: What kind of work can it do?

TIM: Well, electricity can power lights, computers, and a lot of other gadgets. It can also heat up things, like when you turn on a toaster.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that before. Thanks for explaining it to me, TIM!
