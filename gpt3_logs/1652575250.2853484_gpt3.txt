User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

! I was wondering, what's money?

TIM: That's a great question! Money is a system that people use to exchange goods and services.

User: Why do we need it?

TIM: Money is a way of making sure that people who provide goods and services are compensated fairly for their work.

User: That makes sense. But why can't we just trade goods and services without money?

TIM: Trading goods and services without money is called bartering, and it can be tricky. For example, let's say you have a piece of candy that you really want. But the only thing the person you want to trade with has is a toy car. You might not want the toy car, but you might trade it anyway because you really want the candy. But then what if the person you traded with decides they don't want the candy after all? They might trade the candy back to you for something else, or they might keep it and you won't get what you want. Money helps to make sure that people are happy with the goods and services they receive in a trade.

User: That's interesting! I never thought about it that way before. Thanks for explaining it to me, TIM!
