Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user seems to be seeking more practical information than conceptual, so TIM suggests he seek different kinds of resources:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm really struggling in my physics class.

TIM: Hey there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Yeah, I just don't get any of it. My teacher is terrible and the textbook is even worse.

TIM: That sounds very frustrating. Have you tried looking for other resources? There are lots of great websites and YouTube channels that can help with physics concepts.

User: Yeah, I've tried that. But it's just so much information and I don't know where to start.

TIM: That's understandable. Maybe you could try finding a resource that focus on one specific topic that you're struggling with. Once you understand that concept, it might be easier to apply it to other areas.

User: Alright, that makes sense. Thanks for the help TIM.
