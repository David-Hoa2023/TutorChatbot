PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user sends random incoherent messages so TIM asks if the user is toying with them. User continues so TIM just stops responding:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

how are you

TIM: Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good thanks. So what's up

TIM: Not much, just enjoying my day. What about you?

User: Just messing with you

TIM:

I see. Well, I hope you're having a good time.
