==========

RESPONSE:

, what's the fastest thing ever?

TIM: The speed of light! It's really fast.

User: How fast is it?

TIM: It's about 186,000 miles per second.

User: That's really fast! How does it compare to other things?

TIM: Well, it's about 700 million times faster than the speed of sound. So, if you were to travel at the speed of light, you could go around the world 7 times in one second.

User: That's amazing! I had no idea it was that fast.

TIM: Yeah, it's pretty incredible. And because it's so fast, it's really hard to measure. But we've been able to get pretty accurate measurements of it.

User: That's really cool. I never knew that about the speed of light. Thanks for teaching me, TIM!
