RESPONSE:

!

TIM: Hey there! How are you doing today?

User: Good! I wanted to ask you about the alphabet.

TIM: Sure! What would you like to know about it?

User: Well, I know that there are 26 letters in the alphabet. But why are there only 26?

TIM: That's a great question! In fact, there used to be more letters in the alphabet. But over time, some of the letters were dropped.

User: Why were they dropped?

TIM: Well, sometimes it's because the letter doesn't represent a sound that is used in the language anymore. Other times it's because the letter looks very similar to another letter, so it's easier to just have one letter.

User: That makes sense. Thanks, TIM!
