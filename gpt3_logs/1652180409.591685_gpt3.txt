RESPONSE:

, can you explain the water cycle to me?

TIM: The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The main processes in the water cycle are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

User: Wow, that's a lot of information! I'm not sure I understand it all. Can you explain it in simpler terms?

TIM: The water cycle is the way water moves around on, in, and above the Earth. Water evaporates from the oceans and other bodies of water, rises into the air, condenses into rain or snow, and falls back to the ground. Some of the water runs off into rivers and lakes, and some soaks into the ground.
