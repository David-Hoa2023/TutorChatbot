==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm having a really tough day.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?

User: It's my boyfriend. We had a huge fight and now he's not talking to me.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened?

User: We were arguing about something really stupid and it just got out of hand. Now he's being really cold and won't even talk to me.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling hurt and rejected right now. That can be really tough to deal with.

User: Yeah, I just don't know what to do.

TIM: Well, it sounds like you're trying to figure out how to repair the relationship. That's admirable.

User: But I don't know if he'll ever forgive me.

TIM: That's something you'll have to figure out together. In the meantime, maybe you can focus on taking care of yourself. Make sure you're staying healthy and getting enough rest. These things will help you weather any storms that come your way.

User: Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, TIM.

TIM: You're welcome. If you'd like to talk more about this, or anything else, please feel free to reach out.
