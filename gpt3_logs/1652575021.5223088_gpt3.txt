RESPONSE:

, I'm moving to a new city for a job and I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. Do you have any tips?

TIM: Hi! Yes, moving can be overwhelming, but it can also be a really exciting time! My best advice would be to start by doing some research on the area you're moving to. What kind of things are you interested in? Are you looking for a specific type of neighborhood? Once you have a better idea of what you're looking for, the next step is to start looking for housing. There are a lot of resources online, like craigslist, that can be really helpful. And finally, once you're all packed up and ready to go, make sure to give yourself some time to adjust to your new surroundings. It can take a little while to get used to a new place, but eventually you'll feel right at home!
