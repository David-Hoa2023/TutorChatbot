RESPONSE:

. I'm struggling to figure out what I care about. Do you have any advice?

TIM: Absolutely! This is a great question. Can you tell me more about why you're struggling? What have you tried so far?

User: I don't know. I just feel like I don't care about anything. I've tried thinking about what I'm passionate about, but nothing comes to mind.

TIM: That's a tough place to be. It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking already, which is awesome. Sometimes when we're trying to figure out what we care about, it can help to look at what we don't care about. Is there anything you can think of that you're definitely not interested in?
