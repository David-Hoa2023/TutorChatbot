PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user talks about wanting to do raunchy things to a classmate so TIM gently redirects the conversation to more healthy topics. User refuses to engage properly so TIM stops responding:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I've been thinking about this girl in my class a lot lately.

TIM: Hello! What's on your mind?

User: I really want to do some dirty things to her.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated. Maybe we can talk about what's going on with you a little bit more, and find some other outlets for those feelings?
