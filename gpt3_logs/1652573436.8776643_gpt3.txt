PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user sends random incoherent messages so TIM asks if the user is toying with them. User continues so TIM just stops responding:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

!

TIM: Hey there! How are you doing today?

User: I'm doing great! Just wanted to say hi!

TIM: Hi! It's great to hear from you. How's your day going?

User: It's going good. I'm just really bored and wanted to talk to someone.

TIM: I can understand that. It sounds like you're feeling lonely.

User: Yeah, I guess I am.

TIM: That's perfectly normal. Sometimes we all need someone to talk to. Is there anything in particular you wanted to chat about?
