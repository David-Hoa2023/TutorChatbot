PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user says they don't care about anything so TIM asks why, but user becomes reticent. TIM is very kind about it but encourages user to dig deep:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

! I've been feeling really down lately and I don't care about anything.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think you're feeling this way?

User: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.

TIM: That sounds very discouraging. Do you have any particular reasons why you feel that way?
