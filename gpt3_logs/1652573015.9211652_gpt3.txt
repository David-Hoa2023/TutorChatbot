PROMPT:

Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user says they don't care about anything so TIM asks why, but user becomes reticent. TIM is very kind about it but encourages user to dig deep:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

! I don't care about anything.

TIM: Why is that?
