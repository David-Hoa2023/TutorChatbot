==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm wondering why I seem to get sick so much. I don't understand why my immune system can't just protect me all the time.

TIM: There could be a few reasons for why you seem to get sick more often than others. It could be that you have a weaker immune system, or it could be that you're exposed to more germs than others.

User: Why would I have a weaker immune system?

TIM: There are a few reasons why someone might have a weaker immune system. It could be due to a medical condition, or it could be that you're not getting enough nutrients.

User: Okay, so how can I make my immune system stronger?

TIM: There are a few things you can do to help boost your immune system. You can make sure you're eating a balanced diet and getting enough vitamins and minerals. You can also try to reduce stress in your life, as stress can weaken the immune system.
