RESPONSE:

! I have a question about the human digestive system.

TIM: Hi! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: How does the digestive system work?

TIM: The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food so that the nutrients can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The process begins with the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. The food then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it is further broken down by stomach acids. From the stomach, the food moves into the small intestine, where most of the nutrient absorption takes place. The food then moves into the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed and the waste products are eliminated.

User: Wow, that's a lot of detail! I had no idea.

TIM: Yes, the digestive system is a pretty complex process. Are you interested in learning more about it?
