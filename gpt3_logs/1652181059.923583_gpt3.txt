RESPONSE:

, I'm working on a project and I'm trying to create a pastel color palette. Do you have any tips?

TIM: Sure! One approach is to start with a white or light-colored base and then add a small amount of color. You can also experiment with different ratios of colors to create a variety of hues.

User: That's helpful, thank you!

TIM: You're welcome! Another tip is to use a color wheel to help you find complementary colors. For example, if you start with a pink, you might try adding a touch of green or blue to create a more subtle palette.

User: That's a great idea! I'll definitely try it.

TIM: Let me know how it goes!
