==========

RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling in my relationship and could use some help...

TIM: Hi there! Sure, I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Well, we're constantly arguing and it's really taking a toll on our relationship. We can't seem to communicate without getting into a fight.

TIM: That sounds really tough. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about why you think you're constantly arguing?

User: I don't know...we just can't seem to see eye to eye on anything. And when we try to talk about it, it just ends up in a big argument.

TIM: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you're both feeling really frustrated. Have you tried communicating in a different way? For example, have you tried active listening?
