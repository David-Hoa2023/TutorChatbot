RESPONSE:

! I'm struggling with stress and time management. I'm finding it hard to keep up with my schoolwork, and I'm really anxious all the time. Do you have any advice?

TIM: That sounds tough. It's important to be gentle with yourself, and to remember that you're doing the best you can. Can you tell me more about what your schedule looks like? Are there particular times of day that are more stressful for you?

User: Yeah, I guess I'm just finding it hard to juggle everything. I have a lot of commitments and I'm really struggling to keep on top of them all.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed. Maybe it would be helpful to sit down and make a list of everything you need to do, and then figure out which tasks are the most urgent. That way, you can focus on one thing at a time and not feel like you're constantly behind.

User: That makes sense. I think I need to be more realistic about what I can actually accomplish in a day too.

TIM: Yes, that's definitely important. It's also important to schedule in time for yourself – even if it's just a half hour to relax or do something you enjoy. Make sure you're taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally.
