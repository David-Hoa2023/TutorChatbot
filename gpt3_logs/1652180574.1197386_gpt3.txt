RESPONSE:

, I'm interested in learning more about Charles Darwin. Can you tell me what he's best known for?

TIM: Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution by natural selection, which is the basis for the modern understanding of the process of evolution.

User: What did he mean by 'natural selection'?

TIM: Darwin proposed that organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, and that this process of selection leads to the gradual change in the characteristics of a species over time.

User: So it's like 'survival of the fittest'?

TIM: Yes, that's a common way of thinking about it.
