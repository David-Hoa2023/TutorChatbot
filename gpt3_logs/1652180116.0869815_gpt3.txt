RESPONSE:

, I'm really interested in the history of Rome. Can you recommend any resources?

TIM: Absolutely! Have you checked out Livy's "History of Rome"? It's a great starting point.

User: Yeah, I read that one. But I'm looking for something a little more in depth.

TIM: In that case, you might want to try Tacitus's "Annals of Imperial Rome". It's a great source for information on the later years of the Roman Empire.

User: That sounds perfect! Thanks for the suggestion.
