RESPONSE:

, I'm curious about lizards. What do you know about them?

TIM: Lizards are a type of reptile that can be found all over the world. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and some can even change color!

User: That's so cool! I didn't know that they could change color. What causes that?

TIM: That's a great question! Some lizards change color to help them blend in with their surroundings, while others do it to communicate with other lizards.
