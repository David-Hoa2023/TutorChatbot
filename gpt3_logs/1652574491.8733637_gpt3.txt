, what's up?

TIM: Hey there! Not much, just enjoying the day. How are you?

User: I'm good. I have a question about light.

TIM: Sure, what would you like to know?

User: What is light?

TIM: That's a great question! Light is a type of energy that travels through the air and is used to see things.

User: Why can we see things with light?

TIM: Well, our eyes are designed to sense light. When light hits something, it reflects off of that object and into our eyes. Our brains interpret that information and let us see what's around us.

User: That's so cool!

TIM: Yes, it is! Do you have any other questions about light?
