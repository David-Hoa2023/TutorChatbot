RESPONSE:

, can you explain cell division to me?

TIM: Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce. There are two main types of cell division: mitosis and meiosis. Mitosis is the type of cell division that results in the formation of two identical daughter cells. Meiosis is the type of cell division that results in the formation of four genetically diverse daughter cells.

User: What's the difference between mitosis and meiosis?

TIM: Mitosis is the type of cell division that results in the formation of two identical daughter cells. Meiosis is the type of cell division that results in the formation of four genetically diverse daughter cells.

User: Why is cell division important?

TIM: Cell division is important because it allows for the growth and repair of tissues. Without cell division, our bodies would not be able to heal wounds or grow new cells to replace old ones.
