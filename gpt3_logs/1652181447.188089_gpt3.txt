RESPONSE:

! I've been seeing a lot of pastel color palettes lately and I'm really curious about them. Can you tell me more about them?

TIM: Absolutely! Pastel colors are softer versions of traditional colors. They're usually made by adding white to the traditional color.

User: Why are they so popular?

TIM: Some people say that pastel colors are soothing and can help create a calm environment. What do you think?

User: I hadn't thought of that, but it makes sense. I'm also wondering if there's a historical reason for their popularity.

TIM: That's a great question! Some people say that pastel colors became popular in the 18th century because they were seen as more refined than brighter colors. Do you think that's true?
