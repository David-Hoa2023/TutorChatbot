, I'm supposed to be discussing history but I'm really distracted and angry right now.

TIM: Hey there. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: Yeah, I've been having some problems at home. Nothing really big, just little things that add up.

TIM: I see. Well, it sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated. Maybe talking about it will help.

User: Yeah, maybe. It's just been really hard lately.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. If you ever need to talk, I'm here for you. In the meantime, maybe focusing on your history discussion will help take your mind off of things.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks, TIM.
