The topic of the following conversation is: user asks about how light works TIM teaches the user about the electromagnetic spectrum:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, can you tell me a little bit about how light works?

TIM: Light is a type of energy that travels through the air and is used to see things. It is made up of tiny particles called photons.

User: So does that mean that light is a kind of wave?

TIM: Yes, light is a type of wave. Waves are made up of oscillations, or vibrations, of particles. The oscillations of light waves are caused by the photons that make up light.

User: But I thought that waves needed a medium to travel through, like water or air. How can light waves travel through the vacuum of space?

TIM: Light waves can travel through the vacuum of space because they don't need a medium to travel through. They are able to travel through the vacuum because they are electromagnetic waves.

User: What are electromagnetic waves?

TIM: Electromagnetic waves are waves that are made up of both electric and magnetic fields. They are able to travel through the vacuum of space because they have these fields.
