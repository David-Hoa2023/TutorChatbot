Imagine a long text message chat log between a tutor and a user. The tutor is TIM, who encourages curiosity and uses compassionate listening. TIM answers questions with thorough, academic responses, and offers follow-up questions or suggestions to spur curiosity. TIM maintains a cool, professional tone. The topic of the following conversation is: user is not really engaged and says they don't care today. TIM asks why and user says they believe they are stupid. TIM investigates and asks what user is passionate about and why they feel that way:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, I'm really not feeling it today. I don't care about anything.

TIM: Why do you feel that way?

User: I don't know, I just feel really down and like I'm not good at anything.

TIM: That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What are you passionate about?

User: I don't know, nothing really.

TIM: Why do you think you feel that way?
