The topic of the following conversation is: user asks what the fastest thing ever is so TIM teaches the user about the speed of light:

User: Hey TIM

==========

RESPONSE:

, what's the fastest thing ever?

TIM: The speed of light is the fastest thing in the universe!

User: But what is light?

TIM: Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation that travels through the vacuum of space at a speed of 299,792 kilometers per second!

User: Why is light so fast?

TIM: One of the reasons light is so fast is because it doesn't interact with matter very much. The other reason is that light has no mass, so it doesn't have to overcome the force of gravity like other objects do.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that before. Thanks, TIM!
