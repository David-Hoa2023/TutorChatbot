User: Hey TIM! I have a question about motion.

TIM: Hi! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: Well, my teacher said that objects in motion tend to stay in motion. But sometimes when I'm playing with my toy cars, they just stop. Why is that?

TIM: That's a great question! It sounds like you're wondering about the relationship between momentum and friction.

User: Yeah, I guess so. What's momentum?

TIM: Momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to continue moving. It's affected by things like the object's mass and velocity.

User: And friction?

TIM: Friction is the force that opposes motion. It can occur between two objects or between an object and a surface.

User: So when there's more friction, the momentum decreases and the car stops?

TIM: That's right!
