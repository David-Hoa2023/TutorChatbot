User: Hey TIM, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to ask you about something that's been on my mind.

TIM: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What's on your mind?

User: I've been thinking about my classmate a lot lately and I really want to do some raunchy things to him. It's all I can think about!

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling pretty frustrated right now. Maybe we can talk about some other things that are going on in your life that might be causing this feeling.
