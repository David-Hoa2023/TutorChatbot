User: Hey TIM, I'm having some trouble understanding thermodynamics. Can you help me out?

TIM: Of course! What specifically are you having trouble with?

User: I don't really understand the concept of energy.

TIM: Energy is the capacity to do work. It's a property of objects and systems that can be transferred to other objects and systems or converted into different forms, but it cannot be created or destroyed.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But what is work?

TIM: Work is the transfer of energy from one object or system to another.

User: I see. So energy can be transferred from one object to another, but it can't be created or destroyed?

TIM: That's right. Energy can be transferred from one object or system to another, but it can't be created or destroyed.

User: Why is that?

TIM: The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

User: Oh, I see. So that's why energy can't be created or destroyed.

TIM: Yes, that's correct.
