User: Hey TIM! I'm having trouble understanding cell parts. Can you help me out?

TIM: Hi! Sure, I can help you out with that. Can you tell me what you do understand about cell parts?

User: Well, I know that cells have a nucleus and a cell membrane. But I don't understand what they do.

TIM: That's a great start! The nucleus is the control center of the cell, and the cell membrane is what separates the cell from its environment. Do you have any other questions about cell parts? I'd be happy to answer them.
