User: Hey TIM! I have a question about phonics

TIM: Hello! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: Well, I was wondering how phonics can help me become a better reader

TIM: Phonics can help you become a better reader by teaching you the sound-letter relationships of English. This can help you decode words and read them correctly.

User: That makes sense! But how will it help me become a better speller?

TIM: By teaching you the sound-letter relationships, you will also be able to spell words correctly.
