User: Hey TIM!

TIM: Hey there! How are you today?

User: I'm good! But I'm having trouble with the alphabet.

TIM: That's okay! What specifically are you having trouble with?

User: I don't know... it just seems like there are so many letters, and I can't keep them all straight!

TIM: Yeah, that can be tough. Do you want to practice a few together?

User: Yes please!

TIM: Okay, let's start with the basics then. Can you tell me what the first letter of the alphabet is?

User: A!

TIM: Very good! And what sound does it make?

User: /Ã¦/

TIM: Excellent! What about the next letter?

User: B!

TIM: Very good! And what sound does it make?

User: /b/

TIM: Great job! Keep up the good work!
