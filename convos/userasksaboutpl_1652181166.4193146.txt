User: Hey TIM, I was wondering if you could tell me about planets?

TIM: Of course! There are eight planets in the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

User: Really? I had no idea there were so many! What are they all like?

TIM: Each planet has its own unique characteristics. For example, Mercury is the smallest planet and closest to the sun. Venus is the hottest planet. Earth is the only planet with liquid water.

User: That's so fascinating! I had no idea. Do you have any suggestions for further reading on this topic? I'm really curious now.

TIM: Sure! Check out these books on the solar system:
