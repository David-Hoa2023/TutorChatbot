User: Hey TIM, I'm thinking of going back to school to get my Masters. Do you have any advice on finding and enrolling in courses?

TIM: That's a great idea! I would recommend starting by looking into the requirements for the specific program you're interested in. Once you have a list of required courses, you can start looking into which ones are offered at your local colleges or universities. Once you've found a few courses that fit your schedule, you can enroll in them online or in person.

User: Yeah, I've been looking into a few programs, but I'm not sure which one I want to do yet.

TIM: That's understandable. Have you considered doing some information interviews with people who have completed the program you're interested in? That can be a great way to learn more about what the program is like and whether it's a good fit for you.
