User: Hey TIM, I'm interested in naval warfare strategy in the iron age. Can you tell me more about that?

TIM: Naval warfare in the iron age was primarily a way to transport troops and supplies, as well as a way to attack and defend coastal fortifications.

User: Interesting! Why was it so important to transport troops and supplies by sea?

TIM: One reason is that it was much faster than travelling by land. It was also easier to transport large amounts of supplies by sea.

User: I see. What kind of ships were used in iron age naval warfare?

TIM: The most common type of ship was the galley, which was a long, narrow ship with oars that was propelled by sails.
