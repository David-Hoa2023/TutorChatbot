User: Hey TIM, I hope you're doing well. I'm having a tough time focusing today.

TIM: Hey there! I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I was up late last night working. I have to support my family, so I can't really afford to focus on school right now.

TIM: I see. That's a tough situation. Have you talked to your professors about this? They may be able to offer some accommodations or resources.

User: No, I haven't. I'm not sure they'd understand.

TIM: I think it's worth a shot. They may be able to offer some advice or resources that could help you out. Good luck!
