User: Hey TIM, quick question! I was wondering why titanium dioxide is white?

TIM: Titanium dioxide is white because it reflects all visible light. The visible light spectrum ranges from red to violet, and titanium dioxide reflects all of these wavelengths equally.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea.

TIM: Yes, it's a fascinating property of titanium dioxide. Did you know that it's also used in sunscreen?

User: No, I didn't know that!

TIM: That's because it's very good at reflecting ultraviolet light, which is harmful to our skin.
