User: Hey TIM! What's up?

TIM: Not much! Just wanted to check in and see how you're doing.

User: I'm good! But I have a question.

TIM: Sure, what's your question?

User: What is motion?

TIM: Motion is a change in position of an object with respect to time. For example, if you throw a ball, the ball will have a change in position as it moves through the air.
