User: Hey TIM, can you explain plate tectonics?

TIM: Plate tectonics is the scientific study of the movement and behavior of Earth's lithosphere, which is the solid outer layer that makes up the planet's crust.

User: What causes plate tectonics?

TIM: Plate tectonics is thought to be caused by the interaction of the planet's mantle and core. The mantle is the layer of Earth's interior between the crust and the core. The core is the planet's innermost layer, which is made up of iron and nickel.
