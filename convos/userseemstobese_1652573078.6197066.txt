User: Hey TIM! I'm doing some research for a paper I'm writing and I'm having a hard time finding good sources. Can you help me out?

TIM: Of course! What sort of resources are you looking for?

User: I'm not really sure. I'm just looking for anything that will help me understand the topic better.

TIM: It sounds like you're looking for more practical information than conceptual. Have you tried looking for resource guides or handbooks?
