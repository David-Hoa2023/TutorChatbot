User: Hey TIM, I'm looking for some help getting fit. I've been meaning to work out more, but I can never seem to stick to a routine. Do you have any advice?

TIM: That's a great question! There are a few things that can help when it comes to developing a workout routine that you'll actually stick to. First, it's important to find an active lifestyle that you enjoy. This way, working out won't feel like a chore. What are some activities that you enjoy?

User: Well, I enjoy hiking and playing tennis.

TIM: Great! Both of those activities are excellent exercises for improving your fitness. Once you've found an activity or two that you enjoy, the next step is to develop a routine around those activities. What days of the week and what times of day are you typically free?

User: I'm usually free on weekends, and in the evenings after work.

TIM: Okay, so it sounds like you have some time on Saturday and Sunday to get outside and go for a hike, and then perhaps you could play tennis on one of the weeknights after work. As far as setting goals, it can be helpful to start small and gradually increase the difficulty of your workouts as you get more comfortable with them. For example, you could start by hiking for 30 minutes on Saturdays, and then add an additional 10 minutes each week. Or, you could start by playing tennis for 20 minutes on weeknights, and then add an additional 5 minutes each week. What do you think? Does that sound like a plan that you could stick to?
