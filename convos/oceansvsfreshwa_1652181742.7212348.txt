User: Hey TIM, I was wondering if you could help me understand the difference between oceans and freshwater systems?

TIM: Absolutely! Oceans are saltwater systems whereas freshwater systems are, as the name suggests, freshwater.

User: But what's the difference between the two?

TIM: The main difference is in the chemical composition of the water. Saltwater is, of course, salty because it contains dissolved salt. Freshwater, on the other hand, does not contain salt.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But why does that matter?

TIM: The chemical composition of water impacts the organisms that can live in it. For example, most freshwater fish cannot live in saltwater because they would die of osmotic shock.

User: That's interesting! I never would have thought of that.

TIM: Yes, it's a fascinating topic! Oceans and freshwater systems are both incredibly important to our planet and to the life that exists on it.
