User: Hey TIM, I have a question about ecology.

TIM: Hi! Shoot.

User: What is the greenhouse effect?

TIM: The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat by atmospheric gases, which causes Earth’s average surface temperature to rise.

User: How does it work?

TIM: Greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane trap heat from the sun in Earth’s atmosphere. This trapped heat makes Earth’s average surface temperature warm enough to support life.

User: What happens if the greenhouse effect gets out of control?

TIM: If the greenhouse effect gets out of control, it could cause drastic climate change. This could include drastic weather changes, rising sea levels, and mass extinctions.

User: Wow, that sounds really bad. Is there anything we can do to stop it?

TIM: Yes, there are things we can do to stop it. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, planting trees, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are all ways to help stop climate change.
