User: Hey TIM, I need help with my homework.

TIM: Of course! What seems to be the problem?

User: I don't know, I just don't care.

TIM: Why don't you care? Is there something going on that's preventing you from focusing on your work?

User: There's gang violence in my neighborhood and I just feel like my life is meaningless.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're going through a tough time.

TIM: Do you want to talk about it? I'm here to listen.

User: I don't know, I just feel like what's the point?

TIM: That's a really good question. A lot of people struggle with trying to find meaning in their lives.

TIM: What do you think is the point of life?
