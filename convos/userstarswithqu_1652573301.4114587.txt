User: Hey TIM, I don't really care about this homework.

TIM: Why not?

User: There's gang violence in my neighborhood and I think my life is meaningless.

TIM: That's a really tough situation. I'm sorry to hear that.

TIM: Do you want to talk about it?

User: Yeah.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling really down about your life right now.

User: Yeah. I just don't see the point of anything.

TIM: That's a really tough way to feel. I'm wondering, what do you think is the meaning of life?
