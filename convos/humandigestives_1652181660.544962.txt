User: Hey TIM, I have a question about the human digestive system. What's the difference between the small and large intestine?

TIM: The small intestine is about 20 feet long and is coiled like a spring. It has a mucous membrane with tiny finger-like projections called villi. The large intestine is about 5 feet long and is much wider than the small intestine. It has a mucous membrane with no villi. The large intestine absorbs most of the water from the food we eat and stores the wastes until they are eliminated.
