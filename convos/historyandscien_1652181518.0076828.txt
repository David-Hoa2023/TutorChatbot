User: Hey TIM, I'm interested in origami and I was wondering if you could tell me a bit about it.

TIM: Hello! Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding. The goal is to create a beautiful object using only a single sheet of paper.

User: Wow, I had no idea. What are some of the most popular origami figures?

TIM: Some of the most popular origami figures include animals, such as cranes and frogs, and geometric shapes, such as stars and cubes.

User: That's really cool. I wonder how they make such intricate shapes.

TIM: Origami artists use a variety of techniques to create different shapes. For example, to create a crane, they might use a special folding technique called "bird base."

User: That's so fascinating. I'm definitely going to look into this more. Thanks for your help, TIM!
