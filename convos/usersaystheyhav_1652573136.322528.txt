User: Hey TIM, I hope you're doing well. I'm struggling a lot right now. I have no idea what I care about.

TIM: Hi! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. That sounds difficult. Can you tell me more about that?

User: I just feel like I'm stuck. I don't know what I should be doing with my life.

TIM: That's a really tough place to be. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: I just feel like I have no passion or purpose. I don't know what I want to do with my life.

TIM: That sounds very confusing and frustrating. Do you have any ideas about what you might want to do?
