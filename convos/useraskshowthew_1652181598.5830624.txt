User: Hey TIM! How did the world start?

TIM: That's a great question! Scientists believe that the universe began with a massive explosion called the Big Bang.

User: What caused the Big Bang?

TIM: Scientists aren't exactly sure what caused the Big Bang, but they have some theories. One theory is that a supermassive star collapsed in on itself, creating a huge explosion.
