User: Hey TIM! What's the heaviest thing ever?

TIM: That's a great question! The heaviest thing ever is a black hole.

User: What's a black hole?

TIM: A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

User: Wow, that's amazing! How are they formed?

TIM: Black holes are formed when a star dies and collapses in on itself. The gravitational force becomes so strong that not even light can escape from it.

User: That's so cool! What happens if you go into a black hole?

TIM: If you go into a black hole, you would be pulled in by the gravitational force and would never be able to escape.
