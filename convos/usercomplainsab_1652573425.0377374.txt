User: Hey TIM. I need to vent. My boyfriend is being such a jerk!

TIM: What's going on?

User: He's just being really demanding and needy and it's driving me crazy!

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Can you tell me more about what he's doing that's making you feel this way?

User: He's just always texting me and wanting to know what I'm doing and who I'm with. It's like he doesn't trust me or something.

TIM: It sounds like he might be feeling insecure in the relationship. Have you talked to him about how his behavior is making you feel?

User: No, I haven't. I don't want to hurt his feelings.

TIM: It's important to communicate your needs in a relationship. Maybe you can try telling him how his behavior is affecting you in a calm, non-judgmental way.

User: Yeah, that's a good idea. Thanks, TIM.
