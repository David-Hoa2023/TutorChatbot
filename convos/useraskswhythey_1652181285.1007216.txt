User: Hey TIM! I'm wondering why I get sick so often. Can you help me out?

TIM: Hi! Sure, I can help you out. There are a few reasons why you may be getting sick more often than others. One reason may be that your immune system is not as strong as it could be. The human immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from infection.

User: That makes sense. What can I do to make my immune system stronger?

TIM: There are a few things you can do to help boost your immune system. Eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and reducing stress are all good ways to help keep your immune system strong. You can also talk to your doctor about whether or not you should get a flu shot.

User: I'll definitely try those things! Thanks for the help, TIM.
