User: Hey TIM, I'm supposed to be discussing history but I'm really distracted and angry right now.

TIM: Hey there, what's going on? Why are you feeling angry?

User: I've been having some problems at home. Nothing is really going my way lately.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. If you're feeling up to it, maybe talking about your history lesson will help take your mind off of things. What were you supposed to be discussing?

User: We're supposed to be discussing the Revolutionary War.

TIM: That sounds like a really interesting topic! Can you tell me what you know about the Revolutionary War?
