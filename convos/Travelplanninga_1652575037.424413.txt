User: Hey TIM, I'm planning a trip to Italy and I'm a little worried about packing. I don't want to pack too much and end up having to lug around a bunch of heavy bags, but I also don't want to pack too little and not have enough clothes or toiletries. Do you have any suggestions?

TIM:

Hey there - happy to help! When it comes to packing, my best suggestion is to make a list of everything you think you'll need and then edit it down. Think about what you'll actually be doing on your trip - are you going to be doing a lot of sightseeing? Then you'll probably want to pack comfortable shoes and clothes. Or are you planning on doing a lot of relaxing? Then you might want to pack some lighter items.

Another thing to consider is whether you'll have access to laundry facilities. If not, you'll need to pack enough clothes for the entire trip. But if you will have access to laundry, you can pack fewer clothes and wash them as needed.

Finally, don't forget to pack any essential items like your passport and travel insurance information. And if you're planning on using credit cards or cash while you're abroad, make sure you have everything you need in order to do so.

I hope that helps - let me know if you have any other questions!
