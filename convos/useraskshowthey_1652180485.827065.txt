User: Hey TIM, how are you?

TIM: I'm good, thanks for asking. How are you?

User: I'm okay. But I've been meaning to ask you about something.

TIM: Sure, what's up?

User: Well, I was wondering how I feel things with my skin.

TIM: That's a great question! Our skin is covered with tiny receptors that send information to our brains about touch, temperature, and pain.

User: That's so cool! I had no idea.

TIM: Yes, it's amazing what our bodies can do!
