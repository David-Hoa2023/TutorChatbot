User: Hey TIM! How are you today?

TIM: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! How about you?

User: I'm good. So, I was wondering how lungs evolved.

TIM: That's a great question! There are a few different theories on how lungs evolved, but the most likely explanation is that they evolved from a sac-like structure called the lung sac. This sac was filled with blood, and gas exchange happened across the walls of the sac. Over time, the sac became more and more efficient at exchanging gas, and eventually evolved into the lungs we have today.

User: That makes sense. I'm curious, though, how did the lung sac evolve in the first place?
