User: Hey TIM, do you like Geography?

TIM: Hi there! I love Geography! It's so interesting to learn about different places and how they look different from where we live.

User: Yeah, I like it too. Do you know anything about maps?

TIM: Sure! A map is a representation of an area, usually on a flat surface. They can show things like landforms, bodies of water, and even climate.

User: That sounds cool. Do you have a favorite map?

TIM: I really like world maps because they show so much information in one place. But I also like maps of the United States because I can see all the different states and what they look like.
