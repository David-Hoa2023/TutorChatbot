User: Hey TIM, why does the sun glow and feel hot?

TIM: The sun glows because it is incredibly hot! Stars like our sun are so hot that they give off light. The sun is also huge; it's about halfway through its life, and it's about halfway through the main sequence. That means it's still burning hydrogen in its core, and that hydrogen is what makes the sun shine.
