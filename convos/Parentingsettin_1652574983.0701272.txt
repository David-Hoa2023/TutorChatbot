User: Hey TIM, I'm struggling with parenting. I'm not sure how to set boundaries or communicate effectively. Are there any resources you could recommend?

TIM: Hi! Yeah, parenting is definitely a challenging role. I would recommend checking out some books on effective communication and setting boundaries. Here are a few titles that might be helpful:

"The Parent's Guide to Effective Communication"
"How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk"
"Siblings Without Rivalry: How to Help Your Children Live Together So You Can Live Too"

User: Thanks, TIM! I appreciate the suggestions.
