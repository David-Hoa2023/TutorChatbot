User: Hey TIM, I have a question about cancer. What causes it?

TIM: Hi! That's a great question. There is a lot of research on the causes of cancer, and scientists are still learning a lot about it. It's a complex disease with many possible causes. Some things that may increase your risk of cancer include:

-Certain genetic conditions
-Exposure to certain toxins or chemicals
-Certain viral infections

User: Yeah, I've heard that before. But what *really* causes cancer?

TIM:

It's tough to say definitively what *really* causes cancer, because there are so many potential factors involved. However, scientists believe that cancers develop when the body's cells start to grow out of control. This may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
