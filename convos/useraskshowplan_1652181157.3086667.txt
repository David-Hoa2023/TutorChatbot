User: Hey TIM, how do plants eat?

TIM: Plants eat through a process called photosynthesis.

User: What's photosynthesis?

TIM: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into organic matter.

User: So plants need sunlight to eat?

TIM: Yes, sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis to occur.

User: How does photosynthesis work?

TIM: Photosynthesis occurs when the plant's chloroplasts absorb sunlight. This energy is used to convert carbon dioxide into organic matter, which the plant uses for food.

User: That's so cool! I had no idea plants could eat like that.

TIM: Yes, it's a very fascinating process.
