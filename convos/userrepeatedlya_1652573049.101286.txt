User: Hey TIM! I'm having trouble understanding cell parts. Can you help me out?

TIM: Of course. What specifically are you having trouble with?

User: I don't really get what the difference is between the nucleus and the cell membrane.

TIM: That's a great question. Can you tell me what you do understand about the nucleus and the cell membrane?
