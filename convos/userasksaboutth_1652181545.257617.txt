User: Hey TIM! I was wondering if you could explain the water cycle to me.

TIM: Of course! The water cycle, also known as the hydrological cycle, is the process by which water circulates through the Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans.

User: Wow, I had no idea it was called the hydrological cycle.

TIM: Yes, it's a very important part of the Earth's water cycle.

User: Can you tell me more about how it works?

TIM: sure! The water cycle has four main parts: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff.

User: That sounds like a lot of steps!

TIM: Yes, it is a bit complicated, but it's an important process that keeps our planet's water supply clean and fresh.

User: I never knew that! Thank you for explaining it to me, TIM.
