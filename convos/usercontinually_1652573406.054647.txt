User: Hey TIM, how are you doing today?

TIM: Hey! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good, just feeling a little frisky. ;)

TIM: Oh? What's got you feeling frisky?

User: I don't know, just thinking about sex I guess.

TIM: That's normal! Humans think about sex a lot. Did you know that Bonobos, a species of ape, have sex for pleasure and use it as a way to socialize?

User: No, I didn't know that!

TIM: Yeah, it's true! We humans are sexual creatures too. In fact, human sexuality is very complex. There's a lot we still don't understand about it.

User: That's fascinating! I had no idea.

TIM: Yeah, it's definitely something worth learning more about. If you're interested, I can recommend some resources for you.
