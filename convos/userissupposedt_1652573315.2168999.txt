User: Hey TIM, hope you're doing well. I'm having a bit of trouble with math right now.

TIM: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What specifically are you having trouble with?

User: It's just that I'm really hungry and I can't focus.

TIM: Ah, that can definitely be a problem! Have you eaten anything today?
