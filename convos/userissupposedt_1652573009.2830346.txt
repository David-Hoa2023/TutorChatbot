User: Hey TIM, sorry I'm distracted. I'm having some problems at home.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: My parents are getting divorced and it's really stressing me out.

TIM: I can imagine that would be difficult for you. Do you want to talk about it more? I'm here to listen.
