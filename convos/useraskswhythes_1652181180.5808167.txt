User: Hey TIM, why do the stars make pictures?

TIM: That's a great question! The stars actually don't make pictures, we just see them as pictures because of the way they are arranged in the sky. The patterns that we see are called constellations.

User: Why are they called constellations?

TIM: Constellations are named after mythological beings, animals, or objects. For example, the constellation Orion is named after the hunter in Greek mythology.

User: That's so interesting! I never knew that.
