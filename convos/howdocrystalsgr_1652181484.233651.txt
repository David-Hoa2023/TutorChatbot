User: Hey TIM, how are you doing?

TIM: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good. I have a question for you though.

TIM: Sure, what's up?

User: How do crystals grow?

TIM: That's a great question! Crystals grow when molecules come together and bond to form a lattice. The molecules bond together because they have a chemical attraction to each other.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But how do the molecules know where to go?

TIM: That's a great question! The molecules are attracted to each other because they have a chemical affinity for each other. They bond together because they share electrons.
