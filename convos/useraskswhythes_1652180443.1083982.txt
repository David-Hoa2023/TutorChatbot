User: Hey TIM, why do the stars make pictures?

TIM: That's a great question! The stars actually don't make pictures, but we see them as patterns because our brains are good at finding shapes in random arrangements. The patterns that we see in the stars are called constellations.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that.

TIM: Yes, it's pretty neat! There are 88 constellations that have been officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union.
