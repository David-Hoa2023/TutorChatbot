User: Hey TIM! I was wondering if you could help me understand something about dinosaurs.

TIM: Of course! What would you like to know?

User: Well, I was reading that some scientists think that dinosaurs might have been warm-blooded. Is that true?

TIM: Yes, that is true! Some scientists think that dinosaurs might have been warm-blooded because they have found evidence that some dinosaurs had feathers.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea. Do you think that dinosaurs were actually warm-blooded?

TIM: That's a great question! Scientists are still trying to figure out whether or not dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Some scientists think that they were, and some scientists think that they were not. We don't have enough evidence to know for sure yet.

User: That's so fascinating! I never would have thought to ask that. Thank you so much for your help, TIM!
