User: Hey TIM, I'm feeling kind of lost. I don't know what I'm passionate about.

TIM: That sounds tough. Can you tell me more about why you feel that way?

User: I just feel like I should be doing something that I'm really passionate about but I don't know what that is.

TIM: That makes sense. Do you have any ideas about what you might be interested in?

User: Not really. I just know that I need to find something that I'm passionate about.

TIM: Have you tried exploring different things to see what you might be interested in?
