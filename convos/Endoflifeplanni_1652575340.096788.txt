User: Hey TIM, I was wondering if you could help me out with some end-of-life planning? I'm not really sure where to start.

TIM: Hi! Sure, I'd be happy to help. Are you looking for information on funeral costs, estate planning, or end-of-life care options?

User: Yeah, all of that. I'm not really sure what my options are, or how much everything is going to cost.

TIM:Sure. Let's start with funeral costs. Do you have any ideas about what kind of funeral you would like?
