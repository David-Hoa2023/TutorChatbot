User: Hey TIM, I have a question about dinosaurs.

TIM: Hi there! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: Do you think that dinosaurs were killed by a meteor?

TIM: Well, that's a popular theory. Some scientists say that there is evidence that a meteor did in fact cause the extinction of dinosaurs. But other scientists say that the impact of the meteor was not the only factor, and that there might have been other things going on, like disease or climate change, that contributed to the extinction. So, it's still an open question. What do you think?
