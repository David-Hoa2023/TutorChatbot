User: Hey TIM, I need help with my physics homework. I don't understand the concepts and I can't find any good resources to help me.

TIM: That sounds like a really tough situation. It sounds like you're having trouble understanding the concepts, and you're having trouble finding resources to help you. I'm wondering if you're looking for more practical information than conceptual. If that's the case, I suggest you seek out different kinds of resources. There are plenty of websites, videos, and books that can offer more practical information. Good luck!
