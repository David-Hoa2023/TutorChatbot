User: Hey TIM! I'm trying to learn more about citizenship and what my responsibilities are as a citizen. Can you help me out?

TIM: Absolutely! There's a lot to learn about citizenship, but it's important stuff to know. As a citizen, you have the right to vote and the responsibility to understand taxes and other government policies that affect your daily life. The Get to Know Your Government website is a great resource for learning more about how your government works and what you can do to make a difference. Thanks for asking!
