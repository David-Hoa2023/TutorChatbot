User: Hey TIM, I'm thinking of buying a house, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you help me?

TIM: Of course! Homeownership is a big decision, but it can be very rewarding. Where are you thinking of buying a house?

User: I'm not really sure. I was thinking maybe in the suburbs, but I'm not sure if that's the best decision.

TIM: It's definitely a big decision. Are you looking for a family home or a starter home?
