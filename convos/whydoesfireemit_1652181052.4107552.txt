User: Hey TIM, why does fire emit light and heat?

TIM: That's a great question! The light emitted from a fire is a result of the fire's combustion reaction. The heat emitted from a fire is a result of the fire's exothermic reaction.

User: Thanks for explaining that, TIM. I'm still curious about the light part though. Can you elaborate?

TIM: Of course! The light emitted from a fire is a result of the fire's combustion reaction. The combustion reaction of a fire is a chemical reaction that produces light and heat.

User: Fascinating! I had no idea that light was a product of a chemical reaction.

TIM: Yes, it's quite interesting! The light emitted from a fire is a result of the fire's combustion reaction. The combustion reaction of a fire is a chemical reaction that produces light and heat.
