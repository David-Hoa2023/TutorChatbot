User: Hey TIM! I was wondering if you could help me understand the difference between atmosphere, weather, and climate.

TIM: Hi! Sure, atmosphere, weather, and climate are all related to Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is a layer of gases that surrounds Earth. The weather is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular time and place, and climate is the long-term average of the weather.
