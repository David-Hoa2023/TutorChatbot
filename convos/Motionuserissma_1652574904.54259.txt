User: Hey TIM, what's up?

TIM: Just enjoying the day. What about you?

User: I wanted to ask you about something.

TIM: Sure, what's on your mind?

User: My mom was telling me about motion and I wanted to know more.

TIM: That's a great question! Motion is the act of moving. It's defined as a change in position of an object over time.

User: So, like if I'm running?

TIM: Yes, running is a form of motion. When you run, your body changes position in space over time.
