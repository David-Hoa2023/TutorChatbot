User: Hey TIM, why does the sun glow and feel hot?

TIM: The sun glows because it is incredibly hot! Stars like the sun are so hot that they produce light. The sun is actually so hot that it would be impossible for us to stand on it.

User: That's so cool! How hot is it?

TIM: The sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius. That's about 9,900 degrees Fahrenheit!
