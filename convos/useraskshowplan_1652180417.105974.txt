User: Hey TIM, how are you doing today?

TIM: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good. I have a question for you. How do plants eat?

TIM: Plants don't actually eat in the way that animals do. They get their energy from a process called photosynthesis.

User: What's photosynthesis?

TIM: Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert sunlight into energy. They use this energy to create glucose from carbon dioxide and water.

User: So plants don't need to eat food like we do?

TIM: That's right. They get all the energy they need from the sun.
