User: Hey TIM, I need help with math.

TIM: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with math. What specifically would you like help with?

User: I don't know, everything I guess. I'm not very good at math.

TIM: That's okay! math can be tough for some people. But it's definitely doable with a little practice. Let's start with numbers and counting. Can you count up to 10 for me?

User: Yeah, I can do that. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

TIM: Great job! Now, let's try counting by 2s. Can you count up to 20 by 2s?

User: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

TIM: Perfect! Now let's try addition. If I have 2 apples and I add 3 more apples, how many apples do I have in total?

User: 5 apples.

TIM: Exactly! And if I have 5 apples and I subtract 2 apples, how many apples do I have left?

User: 3 apples.
