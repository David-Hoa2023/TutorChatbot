User: Hey TIM, can you explain cell division to me?

TIM: Hi there! Sure, cell division is the process by which a parent cell splits into two or more daughter cells.

User: Is cell division necessary for growth and development?

TIM: Cell division is necessary for the growth and development of all organisms. Without cell division, there would be no new cells to replace old or damaged cells.

User: What happens during cell division?

TIM: During cell division, the cell's nucleus divides into two equal parts, each with its own complete set of chromosomes. The two parts then move to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides into two new cells, each with its own nucleus.
