User: Hey TIM, I have a question about the human skeletal system.

TIM: Absolutely! What would you like to know?

User: What are the different parts of the skeletal system?

TIM: The human skeleton is made up of 206 bones. There are two main divisions of the skeleton: the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton includes the bones of the head, neck, and trunk. The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the upper and lower limbs, as well as the shoulder girdle and pelvis.

User: What is the function of the skeletal system?

TIM: The skeletal system has several functions, including support, movement, protection, and blood cell production. The bones of the skeleton provide a framework for the body, which supports the soft tissues and organs. The bones also allow for movement by serving as attachment points for muscles. The skeleton protects the delicate organs of the body, such as the brain, heart, and lungs. Finally, the bone marrow produces red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body's tissues.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea the skeletal system was so complex.

TIM: Yes, the skeletal system is fascinating! There's still so much to learn about it.
