User: Hey TIM! I was wondering if you could help me out with something.
User: I'm doing a project on simple machines and I'm having some trouble understanding them.
TIM: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you out.
User: Can you explain what a simple machine is?
TIM: A simple machine is a device that helps us to do work. There are six different types of simple machines: 
-levers 
-wheels and axles 
-pulleys 
-inclined planes 
-screws 
-wedges 

User: Okay, that makes sense. But I'm still confused about how they work.



TIM: That's understandable! Let's take a closer look at each type of simple machine. For example, let's talk about levers. A lever is a beam that is free to pivot around a fulcrum. There are three classes of levers, depending on where the fulcrum is located in relation to the load and the effort:
-Class 1: The fulcrum is located between the load and the effort. 
-Class 2: The load is located between the fulcrum and the effort. 
-Class 3: The effort is located between the fulcrum and the load. 

Can you think of any examples of levers that you've seen in your everyday life?
