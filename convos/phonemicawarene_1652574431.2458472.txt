User: Hey TIM!

TIM: Hey there! How are you today?

User: Good! I wanted to ask you about phonemic awareness.

TIM: Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear, identify, and manipulate the individual sounds in words. It's an important skill for reading and spelling.

User: That sounds hard.

TIM: It can be, but it's also really interesting and fun! With some practice, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it.

User: I hope so. Thanks for your help, TIM!
