User: Hey TIM, I'm really not feeling it today. I don't care about anything.

TIM: Why do you feel that way?

User: I don't know, I just feel really down and like I'm not good at anything.

TIM: That doesn't sound like a very positive outlook. What are you passionate about?

User: I don't know, nothing really.
