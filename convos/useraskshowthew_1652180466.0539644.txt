User: Hey TIM, how did the world start?

TIM: That's a great question! The most popular theory is the Big Bang. Scientists believe that the universe began as a very hot, dense point, or singularity. Then, it expanded and cooled, creating the world as we know it today.

User: Wow, that's so cool! I never knew that.

TIM: Yes, it's a fascinating theory. There's still a lot we don't know about the universe, but scientists are constantly learning new things.

User: I'm really curious about this now. Do you have any suggestions for further reading?
