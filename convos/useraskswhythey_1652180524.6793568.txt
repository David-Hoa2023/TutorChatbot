User: Hey TIM, why do we have to poop?

TIM: Pooping is a natural process that helps our bodies get rid of waste. When we eat, our bodies break down the food we eat into nutrients that our cells can use for energy. The parts of the food that our bodies can't use are called waste.

User: But why does it have to come out of our butts?

TIM: Our bodies get rid of waste through the process of digestion. Digestion is when our bodies break down food into nutrients that our cells can use for energy. The process of digestion starts in the mouth with chewing and saliva. Then, the food goes down the esophagus and into the stomach. The stomach acids break down the food even more. From the stomach, the food moves into the small intestine. The small intestine is where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. The food then moves into the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and any remaining nutrients from the food. The waste that is left is called feces. The feces move through the large intestine and into the rectum. The rectum is the last stop before the feces are eliminated from the body through the anus.

User: That's so gross!

TIM: Some people may think that pooping is gross, but it is a natural and necessary process for our bodies to get rid of waste.
