User: Hey TIM! I need some help understanding finances. Can you explain creating and sticking to a budget?

TIM: Sure! When you create a budget, you're essentially allocating your income towards different spending categories. You want to make sure that your spending doesn't exceed your income, so you have to be mindful of how much you're spending in each category. To stick to your budget, you need to be disciplined with your spending and track where you're spending your money. You can use apps or spreadsheets to help with this. Are you trying to create a budget for yourself?
