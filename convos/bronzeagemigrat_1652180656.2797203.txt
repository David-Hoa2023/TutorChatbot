User: Hey TIM, I'm wondering about the bronze age migration into England.

TIM: That's a great question! There are a few theories about this migration. One is that the migrants came from the continent, seeking better land or resources. Another theory is that the migrants were actually indigenous people who had been living in the area for centuries, and only started using bronze tools and weapons in the bronze age.

User: What do you think?

TIM: I think it's probably a combination of both theories. It's likely that there was some migration from the continent, but also that the indigenous people were already living in the area and adopting new technologies.
