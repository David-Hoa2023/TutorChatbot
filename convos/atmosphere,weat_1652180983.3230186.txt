User: Hey TIM, I was wondering if you could explain the difference between atmosphere, weather, and climate?

TIM: Absolutely! The atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth. The weather is the day-to-day condition of the atmosphere, while climate is the long-term average of the weather.
