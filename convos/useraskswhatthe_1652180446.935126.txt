User: Hey TIM, what's the Mickey Way?

TIM: The Mickey Way is a galaxy, which is a collection of stars and gas held together by gravity. Our solar system is located in the Milky Way.

User: That's so cool! How many stars are in the Mickey Way?

TIM: There are an estimated 100-400 billion stars in the Milky Way.

User: That's a lot of stars! How did scientists figure that out?

TIM: Scientists use a variety of methods to estimate the number of stars in the Milky Way. One method is to count the number of stars within a certain area of the sky. Another method is to estimate the mass of the Milky Way and then use the mass-luminosity relationship to calculate the number of stars.

User: Wow, that's amazing! I had no idea there were so many stars in the Mickey Way. Thanks for teaching me, TIM!
