User: Hey TIM! I'm thinking about going back to school to get my degree. Do you have any advice on finding and enrolling in courses?

TIM: That's great! There are a few things to consider when you're looking for courses. First, you'll want to make sure that the courses you're taking will transfer to the school you plan on attending. You can usually find this information on the school's website. Second, you'll want to make sure that the courses you're taking are offered when you're available to take them. And finally, you'll want to make sure that you can afford the courses you're taking.

User: That's really helpful, thank you! I didn't even think about the transferring credits part. Do you have any suggestions on studying for exams?
