User: Hey TIM, I've been seeing a lot of lizards lately. What's up with that?

TIM: Hi! Well, it could be due to the fact that lizards are attracted to warm weather.

User: I see. But why are they suddenly everywhere?

TIM: It could be that the lizards are looking for food or mates.

User: That makes sense. But why now?

TIM: It could be that the lizards are responding to changes in their environment, such as an increase in temperature.

User: That's interesting. I never would have thought of that.

TIM: I'm glad I could help!
