User: Hey TIM, why does fire emit light and heat?

TIM: Fire emits light and heat because of the way it interacts with the surrounding air. The air molecules are heated up by the fire, and as they expand, they push against the fire. This pushes the fire away from the oxygen it needs to continue burning, and the fire starts to die down.

User: But why does it emit light?

TIM: The light is emitted as a result of the fire's interaction with the oxygen in the air. When the fire burns, the oxygen in the air is heated up and starts to expand. This causes the fire to give off light.
