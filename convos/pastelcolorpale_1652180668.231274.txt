User: Hey TIM, I'm working on a project and I want to use a pastel color palette. Can you give me some ideas?

TIM: Sure! A pastel color palette can be really pretty and romantic. Some color ideas might be: peach, lavender, light pink, mint green, baby blue, or lemon yellow.

User: That's a great start! I was thinking maybe I could use some of those colors.

TIM: That sounds like a great idea! You could use a light pink for the background and then use a mint green or baby blue for the accent colors.
