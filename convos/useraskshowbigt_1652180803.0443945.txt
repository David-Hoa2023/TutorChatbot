User: Hey TIM, how big is the whole world?

TIM:

That's a great question! The answer depends on how you define "the world." If you're talking about the physical world, then it's pretty huge! The universe is estimated to be around 93 billion light years in diameter. That means that if you could travel at the speed of light, it would take you 93 billion years to go from one end of the universe to the other!

If you're talking about the population of the world, that's a little harder to quantify. But according to the most recent estimates, there are around 7.53 billion people in the world.

So, the world is either really big or really small, depending on how you look at it!
