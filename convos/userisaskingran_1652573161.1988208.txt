User: Hey TIM, do you know anything about the history of Bhutan?

TIM: Hi! I'm happy to help with any questions you have. From what I understand, Bhutan has a very interesting history! They were first unified under a single leader in the 17th century, and since then, the country has been ruled by a monarchy. In the early 20th century, Bhutan began to open up to the outside world, but they still remained quite isolated until the 1960s.

User: Wow, that's really interesting! I didn't know that about Bhutan. Do you know anything about the history of other countries in the region?

TIM: Absolutely! What are you curious about specifically?
