User: Hey TIM! I hope you're doing well. I wanted to ask you about something that's been on my mind.

TIM: Hi! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What's on your mind?

User: Well, there's this guy in my class that I really like. I can't stop thinking about doing dirty things to him. Is that normal?

TIM: It's normal to feel attracted to someone and to think about sex, but it sounds like you're fixated on this particular person. Maybe you could try focusing on other things, like your hobbies or spending time with friends.
