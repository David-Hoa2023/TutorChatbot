User: Hey TIM! I have some questions about the solar system

TIM: Hi there! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: Well, I know that the sun is really big and really bright. But I don't know how big it actually is

TIM: That's a great question! The sun is huge! It's about 864,000 miles across. That means if you could fit about a million Earths inside of it.

User: Whoa! That's crazy!

TIM: Yeah, it's pretty incredible. What else would you like to know about the sun?
