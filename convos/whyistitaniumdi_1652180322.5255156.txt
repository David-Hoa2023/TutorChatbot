User: Hey TIM, why is titanium dioxide white?

TIM: Titanium dioxide is white because it is a highly reflective material. This means that it reflects a large amount of incident light, which makes it appear white to our eyes.

User: But why does it reflect light so well?

TIM: Titanium dioxide is a very efficient reflector because it has a high index of refraction. This means that when light hits titanium dioxide, a lot of the light is reflected rather than absorbed.
