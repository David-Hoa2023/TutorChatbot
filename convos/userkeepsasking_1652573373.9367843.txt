User: Hey TIM, I have a question about cancer.

TIM: What specifically would you like to know about cancer?

User: I don't really know. I just want to understand what causes it.

TIM: That's a really big question. Maybe a good place to start is with something you do understand, like the immune system. The immune system is important in preventing cancer because it helps the body recognize and destroy abnormal cells.

User: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Thanks, TIM.
