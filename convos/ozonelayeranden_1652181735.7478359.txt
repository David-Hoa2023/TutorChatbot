User: Hey TIM, what's the deal with the ozone layer? I've been hearing a lot about it recently.

TIM: The ozone layer is a layer of the Earth's atmosphere that absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation.

User: Why is it important?

TIM: The ozone layer is important because it protects life on Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.

User: What are the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation?

TIM: Ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and other health problems.

User: So what's being done to protect the ozone layer?

TIM: Various international treaties have been enacted to protect the ozone layer. These treaties have led to the phasedown of production and use of ozone-depleting substances.
