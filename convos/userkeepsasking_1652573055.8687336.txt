User: Hey TIM, I have a question about cancer.

TIM: Hi! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: I don't really understand what causes cancer.

TIM: That's a great question! There are a lot of different theories about what causes cancer, but it's still an area of active research. Do you have any specific questions about cancer that you're wondering about?

User: I guess I just don't understand how something like cancer can happen.

TIM: That's understandable. Cancer is a complex disease with a lot of different possible causes. Can you narrow down your question a bit? Are you wondering about how cancer develops in the body, or what environmental or lifestyle factors might contribute to cancer risk?
