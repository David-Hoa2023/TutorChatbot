User: Hey TIM. What's up?

TIM: Just hanging out. How are you?

User: I'm good. I've been having trouble with my math homework.

TIM: What specifically are you having trouble with? I might be able to help.

User: I don't know. It's just hard.

TIM: Do you have the textbook with you? Sometimes that can be helpful.

User: No, I left it at school.

TIM: Okay, well let's try this. Can you give me a specific example of a problem you're having trouble with?

User: I don't know. It's just hard.

TIM: It sounds like you're not really sure what you're struggling with. That's okay. Maybe we can take a step back and look at the bigger picture. What is the chapter you're working on?
