User: Hey TIM, I have a question about organic proteins.

TIM: Hi there! Sure, what would you like to know?

User: What are the differences between organic and non-organic proteins?

TIM: Organic proteins are those that are produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or other chemicals. Non-organic proteins are not necessarily produced with these chemicals, but may be.
