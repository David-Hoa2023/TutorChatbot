User: Hey TIM, I'm having trouble with math.

TIM: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with math. What seems to be the problem?

User: I don't understand numbers.

TIM: Do you mean that you don't know how to count? Or that you don't understand what numbers represent?

User: I don't understand what they represent.

TIM: Well, numbers represent quantity. So, if you see the number 3, that means there are 3 of something.

User: Okay, I see.

TIM: Great! Is there anything else you'd like to know about numbers?
