User: Hey TIM, what private parts do girls have?

TIM: Well, girls have a lot of the same private parts as boys. They have a vulva, which is made up of the labia, the clitoris, and the opening to the vagina. The vagina is where a girl urinates from and where a baby is born. Girls also have ovaries, which are where the eggs are stored.
