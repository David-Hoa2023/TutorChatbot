User: Hey TIM, what's the fastest thing ever?

TIM: The speed of light! It's pretty amazing.

User: Yeah, but what is it?

TIM: The speed of light is the speed at which light waves propagate through vacuum. It's about 300,000 kilometers per second!

User: Wow, that's fast! But why is it the fastest thing?

TIM: Well, it's the speed at which energy travels through the vacuum of space. And since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, it's the ultimate speed limit.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that. Thanks, TIM!
