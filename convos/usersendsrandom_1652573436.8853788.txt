User: Hey TIM!

TIM: Hey there! How are you doing today?

User: I'm doing great! Just wanted to say hi!

TIM: Hi! It's great to hear from you. How's your day going?

User: It's going good. I'm just really bored and wanted to talk to someone.

TIM: I can understand that. It sounds like you're feeling lonely.

User: Yeah, I guess I am.

TIM: That's perfectly normal. Sometimes we all need someone to talk to. Is there anything in particular you wanted to chat about?
