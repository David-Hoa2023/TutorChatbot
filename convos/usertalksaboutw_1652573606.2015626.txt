User: Hey TIM, I hope you're doing well. I've been having some really dirty thoughts about a classmate and I wanted to talk to you about it.

TIM: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What's on your mind?

User: Well, I can't stop thinking about all the things I want to do to this one girl. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of desire and temptation. Can you tell me more about that? What are some of the things you're imagining doing?

User: I don't know, just dirty stuff. I want to tie her up and do whatever I want to her. She's so hot and I know she wants me too.

TIM: It sounds like you're feeling a lot of sexual tension. Have you ever talked to her about your feelings?

User: No, I don't want to freak her out. But I can't stop thinking about her.

TIM: It sounds like you're really struggling with this. Maybe it would be helpful to talk to somebody else about it, like a counselor or therapist. They could help you explore these feelings in a healthier way.
