User: Hey TIM, how are you feeling today?

TIM: I'm feeling great, thanks for asking! How about you?

User: I'm feeling okay. I was wondering, how do we feel things with our skin?

TIM: That's a great question! Our skin is full of nerve endings that send signals to our brain telling us what we're feeling.
