User: Hey TIM, how come we can see?

TIM: That's a great question! We see because light enters our eyes and is focused by our lenses onto our retinas. The retina is a sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells. These cells convert the light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain via the optic nerve. The brain then interprets these signals as images.

User: That's so cool! I had no idea.

TIM: Yeah, it's pretty amazing how our eyes work! Did you know that the retina has a small area called the fovea that is responsible for sharp central vision? The fovea is packed with cone cells, which are sensitive to light and color.

User: No, I didn't know that. What's the difference between cone cells and other types of cells in the retina?

TIM: Cone cells are unique in that they have the ability to perceive color. The other cells in the retina, called rod cells, are sensitive to light but cannot perceive color.
