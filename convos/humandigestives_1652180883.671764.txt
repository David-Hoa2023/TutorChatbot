User: Hey TIM! I have a question about the human digestive system.

TIM: Absolutely! What would you like to know?

User: How does the digestive system work?

TIM: The digestive system is responsible for breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. The process begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. The food then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it is further broken down by stomach acids. From the stomach, the food moves into the small intestine, where most of the nutrient absorption occurs. The food then enters the large intestine, where water and electrolytes are absorbed and the waste products are eliminated.

User: Interesting! I had no idea it was such a complex process.

TIM: Yes, the digestive system is an amazing feat of human physiology! Are you curious about anything else?
