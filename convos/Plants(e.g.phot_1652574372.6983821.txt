User: Hey TIM! What's up?

TIM: Hey there! Just doing some work on my laptop. What's up with you?

User: I'm bored.

TIM: That's no good! What were you thinking of doing?

User: I don't know.

TIM: Well, let's brainstorm a few things. What do you like to do?

User: I like to play outside and read books.

TIM: Okay, those are both great things! Maybe there's something you can do outside that involves plants. Do you like to garden?

User: No, but I like to go on walks.

TIM: That's great! Maybe you can try to find some plants on your walk and learn more about them. Are there any particular plants you're interested in?
