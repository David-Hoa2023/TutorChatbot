User: Hey TIM, why do I poop?

TIM: Pooping is a normal and necessary part of the human digestive process. When we eat, our bodies break down the food we eat into nutrients that our cells can use for energy and growth. The indigestible parts of the food we eat, along with bacteria and other waste products, become feces. Feces are stored in the large intestine until they are ready to be eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus.

TIM: Pooping is important because it eliminates indigestible food and waste from the body. It also helps to keep the digestive system healthy and functioning properly.

User: What happens if I don't poop?

TIM: If you don't poop, the indigestible food and waste will build up in your digestive system and can cause health problems.
