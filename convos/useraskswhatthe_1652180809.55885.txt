User: Hey TIM, what's the heaviest thing ever?

TIM: The heaviest thing ever is a black hole. A black hole is a point in space where the gravitational force is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it.

User: Whoa, how can something be that heavy?

TIM: Black holes are really dense. They are so dense that a supermassive black hole can have the mass of a large star while being only a few kilometers across.

User: How do black holes form?

TIM: Black holes can form when a star dies. When a star runs out of fuel, it can collapse under its own gravity. If the star is massive enough, it can collapse into a black hole.
