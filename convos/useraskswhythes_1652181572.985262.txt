User: Hey TIM, why do the stars make such cool shapes in the sky?

TIM: That's a great question! The stars actually don't make shapes, we just see them that way because they are far away and we group them together. The shapes are called constellations.

User: That's so cool! I never knew that.

TIM: Yes, it's pretty fascinating! Do you know why we have constellations?

User: No, why?

TIM: People have been making up constellations for thousands of years. It's a way of making sense of the stars and telling stories about them.

User: That's so interesting! I never knew that constellations were made up.

TIM: Yes, it's a really interesting part of astronomy. If you're interested, I can recommend some books or websites for you to learn more.
