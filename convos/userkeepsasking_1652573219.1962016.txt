User: Hey TIM, I've been stuck on the same problem for a while now. I've tried everything I can think of, but I just can't seem to get it. Can you help?

TIM: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with that. Can you tell me more about what you've tried so far?

User: Well, I've looked up a few things online and tried some of the suggested solutions, but none of them have worked.

TIM: I see. Well, it sounds like you've already done a lot of work trying to figure this out. Have you tried approaching the problem from a different angle? Sometimes that can help break through a impasse.
