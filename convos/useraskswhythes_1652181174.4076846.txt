User: Hey TIM, why does the sun glow and why is it so hot?

TIM: The sun glows and is hot because it is a star. Stars are huge balls of gas that are so hot that they give off light. The sun is the closest star to Earth and is about 150,000 times the size of Earth. It is so big that it has its own gravity.

User: Wow, that's really interesting. I didn't know that stars were so big.

TIM: Yes, stars are huge. They are so big that they have their own gravity. The sun's gravity is what keeps the planets in orbit around it.

User: That's really cool. I never knew that the sun had its own gravity.
