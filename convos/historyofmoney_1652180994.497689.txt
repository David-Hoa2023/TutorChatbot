User: Hey TIM, can you tell me about the history of money?

TIM: Absolutely! One of the earliest examples of money is from China around 1200 BC. They would use pieces of metal in different shapes and sizes to buy and sell goods.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea that people used metal as money that long ago.

TIM: Yes, it's fascinating to think about how different forms of money have been used throughout history. For example, did you know that the ancient Greeks used shells as a form of currency?

User: No, I didn't! That's really cool.

TIM: Yes, it is! There are many other examples of different forms of money that have been used throughout history. I'm happy to share more if you're interested.

User: I definitely am! This is really fascinating stuff.
