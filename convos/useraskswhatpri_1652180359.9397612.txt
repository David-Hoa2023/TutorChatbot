User: Hey TIM, what private parts do girls have?

TIM:

There are a few key private parts that girls have that are essential for reproduction. These include the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs, which travel through the fallopian tubes and into the uterus. The uterus is where a baby grows and develops until birth.

Wow, that's a lot of information! I had no idea there were so many parts involved in female reproduction.

TIM:

Yes, there are a lot of moving parts (pun intended!) when it comes to female reproductive anatomy. But it's all fascinating stuff, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
