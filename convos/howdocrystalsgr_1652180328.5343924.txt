User: Hey TIM, how are you today?

TIM: Doing well, thanks for asking! How can I help you?

User: I was wondering how crystals grow.

TIM: That's a great question! Crystals grow in a process called crystallization, which happens when molecules come together and form a regular, repeating pattern.

User: So how do the molecules know how to arrange themselves?

TIM: That's a good question! The molecules are attracted to each other, and they also have a certain shape. The combination of these factors determines how the molecules will arrange themselves.

User: That's really interesting! Thanks for explaining it to me.
