User: Hey TIM:) I hope you're doing well! I wanted to ask you about a couple of words I've been stuck on.

TIM: Hi there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What words are you stuck on?

User: Well, I came across the words 'haphazard' and 'ludicrous' in my reading today. I looked them up in the dictionary, but I'm still not quite sure what they mean. Can you help me out?

TIM: Of course! 'Haphazard' means something that is done without any planning or forethought. 'Ludicrous' means something that is so silly or unreasonable that it is funny.

User: Ah, that makes sense! Thank you so much, TIM.

TIM: You're welcome!
