User: Hey TIM, I'm wondering about the difference between weather and climate.

TIM: Hi! Weather is the condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, while climate is the average weather conditions over a long period of time.

User: Okay, that makes sense. But what causes weather?

TIM: Weather is caused by the interaction of the atmosphere and the sun. The sun heats the earth's surface, which in turn heats the air above it. The warm air rises, while the cooler air sinks. This creates convection currents, which help to drive the weather.
