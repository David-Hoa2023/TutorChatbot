User: Hey TIM! I'm having some trouble understanding cell parts. Can you help me out?

TIM: Of course! What specifically are you having trouble with?

User: Well, I don't really understand what the mitochondria does.

TIM: Do you understand what the cell does?

User: Yeah, it's like the basic unit of life or something.

TIM: That's right. And the mitochondria is often referred to as the "powerhouse" of the cell because it produces energy.

User: Oh, okay. I see. So, what about the nucleus?

TIM: The nucleus is responsible for storing the cell's DNA.

User: I see. And what does DNA do?

TIM: DNA is responsible for encoding the genetic information of the cell.
