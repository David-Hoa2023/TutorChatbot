User: Hey TIM, how's it going?

TIM: Great, just doing some work on my blog. What's up?

User: I was wondering, how does light work?

TIM: That's a great question! Light is actually a type of energy called electromagnetic radiation. It travels through the air as a wave, and is made up of electric and magnetic fields.

User: That's interesting. I didn't know that. What's the difference between electric and magnetic fields?

TIM: Electric fields are created by charges that are at rest, while magnetic fields are created by charges that are in motion.

User: I see. So, is light a type of electricity?

TIM: No, light is not a type of electricity. Electricity is a type of energy that is used to power things like lights and appliances. Light is a type of energy that is used to see.
