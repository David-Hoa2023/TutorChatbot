User: Hey TIM! I'm thinking about buying a house, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you help?

TIM: Of course! Are you looking to buy a house outright, or get a mortgage?

User: I was thinking about getting a mortgage.

TIM: That's a great idea! Mortgages can be a great way to finance a home. Can you tell me a little bit more about your plans? Are you looking to buy a new home, or an existing home?
