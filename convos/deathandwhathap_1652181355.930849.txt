User: Hey TIM, I've been wondering about death a lot lately. What happens when we die?

TIM: Well, that's a really big question with a lot of different possible answers. Some people believe that when we die, our soul leaves our body and goes to a different place. Others believe that our soul is reborn into another person or animal. And still others believe that when we die, our soul simply ceases to exist. What do you think happens when we die?
