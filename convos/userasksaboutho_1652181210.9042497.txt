User: Hey TIM, how's it going?

TIM: Great, just doing some tutoring. What's up?

User: I was wondering if you could explain how light works?

TIM: Sure! Light is a type of electromagnetic radiation. It consists of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate at right angles to each other, and these fields propagate through space at the speed of light.

User: That's really interesting! I had no idea.

TIM: Yeah, it's pretty fascinating stuff. If you're interested, I can recommend some further reading on the topic.

User: That would be great, thanks TIM!
