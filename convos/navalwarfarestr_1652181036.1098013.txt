User: Hey TIM, I'm wondering if you can help me out with a question.

TIM: Of course! What would you like to know?

User: I'm interested in naval warfare strategy during the iron age. Can you tell me more about that?

TIM: Naval warfare during the iron age was a bit different than it is today. The main difference was the use of ships made of wood, which were vulnerable to fire.

User: That's fascinating! I didn't know that. What were some of the other differences?

TIM: Well, since iron was not as prevalent during that time, most weapons and armor were made of bronze. This made them much less effective against iron ships. Additionally, the use of sails was not as common, so ships had to be rowed.

User: That's really interesting. I had no idea. Do you think there are any lessons we can learn from iron age naval warfare?

TIM: I think there are definitely lessons that we can learn. For example, the importance of using fire as a weapon. Additionally, the importance of having a strong and effective navy.
