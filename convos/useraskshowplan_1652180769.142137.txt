User: Hey TIM, how are you today?

TIM: I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good. I was just wondering, how do plants eat?

TIM: That's a great question! Plants get their energy from the sun through a process called photosynthesis.

User: How does that work?

TIM: Photosynthesis is the process that produces organic molecules from simple inorganic molecules from the sun's energy. The sun's energy is converted into chemical energy that is stored in the bonds of the organic molecules.
