User: Hey TIM, how come we can see?

TIM: The eye is an amazing organ that allows us to see the world around us. The eye has a lens that focuses light on the retina, which is a layer of light-sensitive cells. The retina has a small area called the fovea, which is responsible for sharp central vision. The optic nerve carries signals from the retina to the brain, where they are interpreted as images.

User: Wow, I had no idea! How does the lens work?

TIM: The lens is a clear, curved structure that helps to focus light on the retina. The curvature of the lens determines how much light is bent, which affects how we see objects.

User: That's really interesting! I never knew that before.
