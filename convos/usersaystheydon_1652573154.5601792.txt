User: Hey TIM! I've been feeling really down lately and I don't care about anything.

TIM: I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think you're feeling this way?

User: I don't know. Everything just seems pointless.

TIM: That sounds very discouraging. Do you have any particular reasons why you feel that way?
