User: Hey TIM, do you have a minute to chat?

TIM: Of course! What's up?

User: I was wondering if you could tell me about death. What happens when we die?

TIM: That's a great question! There are a few different theories out there about what happens when we die, but no one really knows for sure. Some people believe that our soul goes to a different place, while others believe that our consciousness simply ceases to exist.

User: That's interesting. I've always wondered what happens to our consciousness when we die.

TIM: There's no way to know for sure, but it's a fascinating topic to think about!
