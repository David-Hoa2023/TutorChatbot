User: Hey TIM, I'm supposed to be discussing history but I'm really distracted and angry right now.

TIM: Hi there. I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling distracted and angry. Can you tell me more about what's going on?

User: It's just some stuff going on at home. None of your business.

TIM: I understand that you may not want to share the details, but can you tell me if there's anything I can do to help you focus on our discussion?
