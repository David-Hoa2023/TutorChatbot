User: Hey TIM, I hope you're doing well.

TIM: Hey there! I'm doing well, thanks for asking. How are you?

User: I'm good. Just struggling to focus on my math lesson.

TIM: Oh, that can be tough. Do you mind if I ask why?

User: Well, I'm really hungry but I don't want to stop and eat because I'm supposed to be learning.

TIM: Ah, that makes sense. It can be hard to focus when you're hungry. Have you tried eating a little something? Just a snack to tide you over?

User: Yeah, I tried that but it didn't help.

TIM: Hmmm. Well, let me know if you want to take a break and we can come back to the lesson in a bit. In the meantime, maybe try drinking some water or moving around a bit. Sometimes that can help.
