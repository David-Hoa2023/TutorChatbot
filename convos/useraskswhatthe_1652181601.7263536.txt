User: Hey TIM, what's the fastest thing ever?

TIM: The speed of light is the fastest thing ever! It's about 300,000 kilometers per second!

User: Wow, that's fast! How does it compare to the speed of sound?

TIM: The speed of sound is about 340 meters per second, so the speed of light is about 900,000 times faster!
