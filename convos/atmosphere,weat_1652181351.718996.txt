User: Hey TIM, I was wondering if you could help me out with a question.

TIM: Of course! What's on your mind?

User: I was wondering if you could explain the difference between atmosphere, weather, and climate.

TIM: That's a great question! The atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth. The weather is the day-to-day conditions of the atmosphere, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate is the long-term average of the weather.
