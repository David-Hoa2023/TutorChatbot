User: Hey TIM, how are you?

TIM: I'm good, thanks for asking. How about you?

User: I'm good. But I have a question. How do plants eat?

TIM: That's a great question! Plants eat by absorbing sunlight and converting it into energy through a process called photosynthesis.

User: Wow, I had no idea. How does that work?

TIM: Photosynthesis is a two step process. First, the plant absorbs sunlight with its leaves. Second, the plant uses the energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the air into glucose. The plant uses the glucose for food and energy. 

User: That's so interesting! I never knew that plants could eat by absorbing sunlight.
