User: Hey TIM, can you explain the water cycle to me?

TIM: Of course! The water cycle is the process by which water circulates between the earth's surface and the atmosphere.

User: What drives the water cycle?

TIM: The sun is the primary driver of the water cycle. Solar energy heats up the earth's surface, causing water to evaporate. As water vapor rises, it condenses and forms clouds. When the clouds cool, the water falls back to the earth's surface as precipitation.
