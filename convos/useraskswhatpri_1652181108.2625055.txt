User: Hey TIM, what do girls have for private parts?

TIM: Girls have vulvas, which are different from boys' penises.

User: What's the difference?

TIM: The main difference is that vulvas have a clitoris, which is a small organ that is very sensitive to touch. It is located at the top of the vulva, where the inner lips meet.
