User: Hey TIM! I was wondering, why would black be good as a heat emitter?

TIM: Black is a good heat emitter because it absorbs all colors of light and converts them into heat.

User: That makes sense! I never would have thought of that.

TIM: That's great! Curiosity is key to learning. Would you like to know more about how light is converted into heat?
